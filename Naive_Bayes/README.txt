Step to run Naive Bayes text classification
-----------------------------
Naive Bayes without Stop Words
-----------------------------

Workspace : NB
Class : NB

Add runtime arguments as
args[0] = location of training set ham words
args[1] = location of training set spam words
args[2] = location of testing set ham words
args[3] = location of testing set spam words
The project is about classifying the emails in Ham and spam using Naive bayes and Logistic regression model. 
The Naive Bayes and Logistic regression algorithms are implemented using Java.

Naive Bayes with Stop Words
-----------------------------

Workspace : NB
Class : NB_stopwords

Add runtime arguments as
args[0] = location of training set ham words
args[1] = location of training set spam words
args[2] = location of testing set ham words
args[3] = location of testing set spam words
args[4] = location of stopwords.txt
